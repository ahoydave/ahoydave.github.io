title: "Building a Personal Blog with Jekyll"
---

This site itself, [ahoydave.github.io](https://github.com/ahoydave/ahoydave.github.io), is my personal blog platform built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

I wanted a simple, clean space to share thoughts and document projects without the complexity of a full CMS or the noise of third-party blogging platforms. Jekyll fit perfectly—it's minimal, it handles markdown beautifully, and the entire site is version controlled. No databases, no complex infrastructure, just static HTML and Git.

The beauty of this approach is that writing is just writing. There are no algorithms, no distractions, no platform trying to optimize for engagement time. You write in markdown, push to GitHub, and it's live. It's surprisingly freeing to have full control over your own writing space. The site is open source and serves as both my platform and a reference for anyone interested in building something similar. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahoydave/ahoydave.github.io).
