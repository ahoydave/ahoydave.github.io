title: "Dotfiles: Configuration as Code"
---

I've published my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ahoydave/dotfiles) on GitHub—basically my entire development environment configuration in one place.

For years I'd set up new machines and find myself manually configuring the same tools, same keybindings, same settings across different systems. It was frustrating and error-prone. The real breakthrough came when I realized that treating your dev environment like code—versioned, shareable, reproducible—saves so much time and mental energy.

My dotfiles include shell configuration, tool settings, and all the little tweaks that make my development workflow efficient. By keeping them in version control, I can now spin up a new machine and be productive in minutes instead of hours. It's a small thing, but it's one of those quality-of-life improvements that compounds over time. Check them out on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahoydave/dotfiles) if you want to see how someone else organizes their environment.
