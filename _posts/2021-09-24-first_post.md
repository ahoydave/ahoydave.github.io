# This is a post. A test post

Hi everyone. Look I wrote a post.

You can have _math_
$$
h(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{N}w_{ij}S_i(t)
$$

And you can have code
``` clojure
(defn addone
 "Adds one"
 [x]
 (+ x 1))

(addone 100)
;; => 101
```
But do we have live reload? No. We do have auto-rebuild though which is good enough I guess.
