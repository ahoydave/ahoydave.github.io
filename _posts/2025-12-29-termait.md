title: "Introducing termait: Natural Language in the Terminal"
---

I built [termait](https://github.com/ahoydave/termait), an AI-powered CLI tool that translates natural language into shell commands.

I've always struggled to remember the right syntax. Some commands I use daily, others maybe once a month, and I find myself constantly searching for the right flags and options. It's frustrating when you know *what* you want to do but can't recall *how* to express it in shell syntax.

With termait, you just describe what you want in plain English. Instead of hunting through man pages or Stack Overflow, you can focus on the task at hand and let AI handle the command syntax.

It's written in Python and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahoydave/termait). I'm loving how much less we have to struggle with memorizing these things.
