title: "Introducing termait: Natural Language in the Terminal"
---

I built [termait](https://github.com/ahoydave/termait), an AI-powered CLI tool that translates natural language into shell commands.

Instead of trying to remember the right flags and syntax, just describe what you want to do in plain English. termait figures out the command for you.

It's written in Python and available on GitHub. Check it out if you want to write shell commands the easy way.
