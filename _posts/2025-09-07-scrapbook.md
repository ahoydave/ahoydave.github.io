title: "Scrapbook: Social Media Reimagined"
---

I created [scrapbook](https://github.com/ahoydave/scrapbook), a social media platform built with a fresh vision of what social networks should actually be.

The core frustration that sparked this project is simple: most social media platforms are optimized for engagement metrics rather than genuine connection or user control. Algorithms push sensationalism, endless scrolling is the default, and you have limited control over your own content. Scrapbook is my take on what social media could be—intentional, personal, and put the user back in control.

It's a JavaScript-based project that explores different UI/UX patterns and a philosophy around how social platforms should work. The vision is social media "the way it was meant to be"—fostering real connection rather than maximizing time-on-app metrics. It's been a fun exploration of building something better, even if just as a proof of concept. You can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahoydave/scrapbook) and see what a different approach to social media might look like.
