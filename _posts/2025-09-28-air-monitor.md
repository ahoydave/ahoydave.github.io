title: "Building a DIY Air Quality Monitoring System"
---

I built [air-monitor](https://github.com/ahoydave/air-monitor), a complete air quality monitoring system with custom hardware, a backend API, and a web frontend.

The whole project came from wanting to understand what's actually in the air I breathe every day. I was curious about particulate matter, humidity, temperature—all those environmental factors that directly affect health but rarely get attention unless something goes wrong. Building the device from scratch gave me insights into IoT development, sensor integration, and what's involved in collecting and visualizing real environmental data.

The project includes the firmware for the air quality sensor device, a backend service to collect and process the data, and a frontend dashboard to visualize it all. It's been a rewarding deep dive into the full stack of IoT—from hardware concerns like sensor calibration to the software side of data aggregation and visualization. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahoydave/air-monitor) if you're interested in building something similar.
