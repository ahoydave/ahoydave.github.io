title: "Useful Scripts: Command-Line Utilities for Daily Tasks"
---

I've gathered a collection of [useful_scripts](https://github.com/ahoydave/useful_scripts)—a repository of shell scripts that solve everyday problems and make command-line work more efficient.

These are the kinds of scripts that emerge naturally when you spend a lot of time at the terminal. You notice repetitive tasks, write a quick utility to automate them, and suddenly you've saved yourself hours over a week. Some handle file organization, others manage system tasks, a few automate development workflows. Nothing fancy or revolutionary, just practical tools that actually get used.

The beauty of collecting these in one place is that they become shareable and refinable. What starts as a one-off solution can evolve into something genuinely useful. If you're a command-line person, you probably have similar scripts scattered across your machine—you might find something useful here or get inspired to organize your own.
