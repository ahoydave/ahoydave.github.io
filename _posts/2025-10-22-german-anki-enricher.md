title: "German Anki Enricher: AI-Powered Language Learning"
---

I built [german-anki-enricher](https://github.com/ahoydave/german-anki-enricher), a Python script that uses Claude to create rich Anki flashcards from my German vocabulary list.

Learning German has been one of those projects that requires consistency and engagement. Anki is great for spaced repetition, but I found that creating good cards—with natural examples, context, and proper conjugations—takes time. The idea was simple: what if I could automate the tedious part and let AI generate contextual, grammatically accurate examples while I focus on the learning itself?

The script takes my vocab list and uses Claude to create complete Anki cards with example sentences, translations, and usage notes. It's saved me hours of manual card creation and made my study sessions more effective. The tool captures the sweet spot where automation handles the busy work and lets you focus on actual learning. You can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahoydave/german-anki-enricher) if you're learning languages and tired of creating flashcards by hand.
