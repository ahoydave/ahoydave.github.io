title: "pty-wrap: Giving Coding Agents Terminal Superpowers"
---

I built [pty-wrap](https://github.com/ahoydave/pty-wrap), a Python tool that enables coding agents to interact with interactive terminal programs.

The motivation here is pretty straightforward: AI agents are becoming more capable at writing and understanding code, but they were stuck when it came to interactive tools. Most terminal programs expect human input—confirmations, menu selections, real-time interaction. I wanted to bridge that gap and let agents work seamlessly with the full range of command-line tools, not just simple scripts.

The tool wraps pseudo-terminal (pty) interactions, making it possible for agents to drive interactive programs, handle stdin/stdout properly, and deal with the quirks of terminal interfaces. It opens up a lot of possibilities for automation and agentic workflows that previously weren't feasible. If you're working on AI agents or trying to automate complex terminal workflows, check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahoydave/pty-wrap).
