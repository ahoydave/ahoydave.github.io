title: "Pelosi Trade Bot: Tracking Political Insider Trading"
---

Chasing alpha by copying politicians' trades. This will probably lose me money, and it's exactly the kind of thing I tell people not to do.

Built in Rust because I wanted to try it out with coding agents—the compiler safety makes it really good for the verifiability required when you're working with agents. Less time debugging obscure runtime errors, more time actually building.
