title: "Pelosi Trade Bot: Tracking Political Insider Trading"
---

I built [pelosi-trade-bot](https://github.com/ahoydave/pelosi-trade-bot), a Rust-based tool that follows US politicians' trades in real-time.

There's something fascinating about financial transparency and market behavior. Politicians have access to non-public information, and tracking their trades creates an interesting lens into what they're really betting on. This project started as an exploration of data collection, real-time processing, and building something that aggregates public financial data in a useful way.

The bot monitors and reports on trades executed by US politicians, giving you visibility into patterns and opportunities to learn from their market decisions. It's written in Rust for performance and reliability, which felt like the right choice for a tool that needs to reliably track and process financial data. If you're interested in market transparency or the intersection of politics and finance, you can explore it on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahoydave/pelosi-trade-bot).
